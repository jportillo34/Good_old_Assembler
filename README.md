## Some peaces of code i used early on 1980's - 1990's

 In some of those programs i used a pseudo-Pascal (high level) language on which i (first) designed the algorithms and then made a kind of hand-translation process (years later I found that this same procedure was used by russian programmers during 1950's and also was used by the IBM programmers that developed software for the Apollo-Saturn digital computer during the Apollo lunar program).
